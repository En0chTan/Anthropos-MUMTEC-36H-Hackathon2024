### Project Overview
[Provide a brief description of your project. Include the problem you are solving, your approach, and the impact of your solution.]

- **Problem Statement**: Inefficiant use of Arduino function by the hobbyist community and beginners 
- **Proposed Solution**: [Describe your AI-powered solution, highlighting its key features and benefits.]

---

### Technologies Used
[List all the technologies, programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools used in the project. Include any external APIs or datasets.]

- Python 3.7
- Groq
- Javascript
- Bun.js
- Arduino UNO

### Why pick Groq?
Groq is one of the most accessible and free AI APIs currently available in the market. With its impressive processing speed and diverse range of models, we believe that Groq represents the ideal starting point for developers looking to start their AI journey.

For the models, we selected both **llama3-70b-8192** and **llama-3.1-70b-versatile** as both of them are optimal for their respective tasks.

### Usage
[Describe how to use your application. Include example commands, expected inputs, and outputs.]

--- 

### Features

- The optimized, plug-and-play code should be directly compatible with the Arduino IDE for seamless compilation.
- A simple interface, easy to use and understand
- User experience: Copy the code from the Arduino IDE, paste it into our app for optimization, then paste it back into the Arduino IDE.
- Improve the performance of the main loop, enhancing the overall speed and efficiency.
